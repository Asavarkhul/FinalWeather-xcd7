# FinalWeather

## Intro
You'll make a simple Weather App for a given city. The app should be available offline and should give current weather, the forecast, and additional informations such as wind, pressure, humidity, etc. 

You can use other libraries to speed up the development process and you should make regular commit (be sure to have proper commit comments).

Take the time you want (or canâ€¦) based on a good ratio between productivity and over-engineered product. Do not spend more than 2 days on that!!

## Minimum requirements:
- iOS 9 & Swift
- Android API 19 (4.4 KITKAT)
- Windows (Caliburn - WinRT or Windows 10 UWP)

## The App
### Step 1: Data Model
- Define your model based on the need of the project
- Use the appropriate framework to handle data storage

### Step 2: Network
- Get the current weather for Lyon, FR and the forecast for the next days. 
- API to use: http://openweathermap.org/api (You're free to choose another one if you want to)

### Step 3: UI
- Show us what you would do
- Make sure to have an adaptive layout for smartphone and tablet
